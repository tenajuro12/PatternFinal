Project Name: FlightBookingSystem

Group: SE-2222

Team Members: SABYROV TENELBEK

Project Overview:
The FlightBookingSystem is a web-based Java project developed by the SE-221X group. The system is designed to facilitate flight searches, bookings, and administration. It consolidates data from various airlines using globally distributed systems, providing real-time rates to customers and travel agents. The system includes features for both users and administrators, allowing users to search, book tickets, and view their bookings, while administrators can add flights and view all available flights.

Purpose of the Work:
The purpose of the FlightBookingSystem is to streamline the flight booking process for users and administrators. It aims to provide a user-friendly interface for customers to easily search for flights, book tickets, and view their bookings. Additionally, it assists administrators in managing flight information efficiently.

Objectives of the Work:

Create a user-friendly web-based Java application for flight bookings.
Implement features for users to search, book tickets, and view bookings.
Implement features for administrators to add flights and view all available flights.
Incorporate design patterns to enhance the system's flexibility, maintainability, and extensibility.
